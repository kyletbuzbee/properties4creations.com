                        Properties 4 Creations isn't just a housing provider; it's a mission born from military service.
                        <strong class="text-brand-navy">We rebuild communities.</strong> We understand that the foundation of a stable life is a safe, dignified home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We take distressed properties in East Texas and transform them into premium family sanctuaries.
                        We don't just "flip" houses—we rebuild communities, one home at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our promise is simple: We treat every tenant with the respect they deserve, providing
                        responsive management, fair pricing, and homes we would be proud to live in ourselves.
